# React ToDo
Simple Todo with authentication and task planning.

## API
For authentication I used http://nestjs-boilerplate-test.herokuapp.com/docs/.

Since I didn't find suitable API for tasks, I use localStorage for task saving.

## Styles 
Base part of app builded on Material UI.

## Modules 
Routing: [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start).

State manager: [React Hooks and Context](https://medium.com/octopus-labs-london/replacing-redux-with-react-hooks-and-context-part-1-11b72ffdb533).

Form validation: [React Hook Forms](https://react-hook-form.com/) & [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup).
